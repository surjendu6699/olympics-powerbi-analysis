Olympic Power BI & Python Analysis

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Olympic athlete data, combining the power of Power BI for interactive visualizations with Python for data preprocessing and statistical insights.

Key Steps & Process:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Conducted in Python, including handling of missing values, standardization, and formatting.

Outlier Detection:
Outliers in athlete age and weight were detected using Python (e.g., Z-score or IQR methods) to ensure data integrity and improve analysis accuracy.

Python Visualizations:
Before importing into Power BI, key trends and distributions—such as age, weight, and medal correlation—were visualized in Python (using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn).

Power BI Dashboards:
Final insights and visual storytelling were developed using Power BI Desktop, including the following charts:

Age and Weight by Medal

Gender Distribution

Sport-wise Participation

This hybrid workflow enables deeper data exploration and more accurate visual insights.
