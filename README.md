Olympic Power BI & Python Analysis

This project combines Python and Power BI to deliver a data-driven analysis of Olympic athlete performance and demographics. It highlights trends across sports, gender, age, and medal distribution.

🔍 Key Workflow:

Data Preprocessing (Python):
Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and formatted data for consistency.

Outlier Detection (Python):
Detected and handled outliers in athlete age and weight using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).

Python Visualizations:
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize initial data trends and validate preprocessing steps before Power BI integration.

Interactive Dashboards (Power BI):
Built dynamic reports and dashboards with the following key visuals:

📊 Age and Weight by Medal

👥 Gender Distribution

🏅 Sport-wise Participation
